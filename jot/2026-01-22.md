## What You Did

You built and shipped an entire SaaS product in one evening. Started with `create-next-app` at 9:53 PM, then cranked out a full MVP by 10:02 PM - GitHub OAuth, dashboard, cron jobs generating AI reflections, email delivery, Stripe billing, the works. Then spent the rest of the night deploying to production, fixing deployment issues, and adding polish features like dark mode, timezone support, and instant reflections on repo connect.

You went from zero to a live product at jotgrowsideas.com with paying customers able to sign up. That's real momentum.

## Observations

That massive 2,531 line commit at 10:02 PM tells a story - you were in deep flow state and just built the whole thing. Impressive, but also risky. If something broke, you'd have a hell of a time debugging.

After deployment, you got sucked into feature creep. Dark mode toggle? Timezone support? Writing reflections back to the repo? These feel like distractions from validating the core value prop. You built a lot of "nice to haves" when you should probably be focused on "must haves."

The constant commit stream until 11:47 PM suggests you couldn't stop tinkering. That's both good (momentum) and bad (perfectionism over shipping).

## Questions for Tomorrow

1. **Are you going to actually get users trying this, or keep polishing features?** You have a working product - time to validate demand, not add dark mode.

2. **What's the one metric that proves this works?** Daily active users reading their reflections? Retention after first week? Figure that out and optimize for it, not feature count.
