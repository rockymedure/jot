## What You Did

You shipped a major feature today: AI-powered code reviews using Anthropic's Agent SDK. Built the entire pipeline from API endpoint to UI, including review analysis, accordion display, and copy-to-markdown functionality. Also hardened security across API endpoints with proper validation, webhook signatures, and RLS policies.

Added LLM-generated summaries for reflection cards and the ability to regenerate reflections on demand. Plus the usual infrastructure wrestling - Railway deployment configs, Docker permissions, nixpacks migration.

## Observations

Strong morning momentum on the big stuff - security hardening and the core Agent SDK integration were solid foundational work. But the afternoon got fragmented. You spent way too much time on deployment debugging (nixpacks → railway.toml → Docker user permissions) and tiny bug fixes like apostrophe escaping in emails.

The accordion UI and markdown copy features are nice polish, but you did 4 separate commits just cleaning up asterisks in file paths. That's classic yak shaving. The email greeting fixes could have waited or been batched with other small improvements.

You clearly got the review feature working since you were polishing the UI, but all those deployment commits suggest users might still be hitting issues in production.

## Questions for Tomorrow

1. Is the code review feature actually working end-to-end for users in production, or are there still deployment/infrastructure issues blocking adoption?

2. Can you batch small UI fixes into focused polish sessions instead of context-switching throughout the day?
