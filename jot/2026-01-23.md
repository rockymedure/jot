## First Impressions

I see what you've built here, and honestly? It's brilliant in its simplicity. You've created something I wish I'd had when I was grinding alone on projects - a brutally honest mirror for your development process. No sugar-coating, no productivity theater, just "here's what you actually accomplished and here's what that says about where you're going."

The fact that jot is literally committing its own reflections to your repo tells me everything I need to know about whether you believe in this product. You're eating your own dog food daily, which means you've solved a real problem you personally felt.

The tech choices are solid - Next.js 16, Supabase, Claude, Stripe. You built for scale from day one without over-engineering. The whole flow from GitHub OAuth to daily email delivery is clean and purposeful.

## Where You Are

You're clearly past the "will this work?" phase and deep into "how do we make this work better?" The commits from the last few weeks show someone polishing a product they believe in. The real-time streaming for reflections, the timezone support, the email template improvements - these aren't MVP features. These are "people are actually using this and I want it to be great" features.

The fact that you added delete functionality and then ripped it back out is fascinating. That suggests you're thinking hard about the user experience and maybe realized that letting people delete their reflections defeats the purpose of honest accountability.

You're in the refinement phase, but I suspect you're also at a decision point about growth.

## Questions I Have

**What's the real vision here?** You've built something that works beautifully for solo developers, but is jot meant to stay intimate and personal, or are you thinking about teams, organizations, different types of reflections? The core insight about daily reflection is powerful - how far do you want to push it?

**How do you plan to find your first 100 users?** You've got product-market fit with yourself, but that's the easy part. Developer tools are notoriously hard to market. Are you thinking content, community, word-of-mouth? What's the plan beyond "build it and they will come"?

**What are you avoiding building?** I notice the product is very focused - daily commit reflections, period. No integrations with Slack, no team features, no fancy dashboards. Is that discipline or are there features you're deliberately not building because you're worried about scope creep?

Looking forward to diving into this with you. You've built something real here.
