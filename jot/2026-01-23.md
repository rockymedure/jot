## What You Did

You shipped the core reflection loop. Users can now connect a repo, get an instant reflection that actually understands their project (README, commits, project phase), and have future reflections written back to their repo automatically. The timezone support and proper commit tracking across all branches were smart infrastructure moves that prevent future user complaints.

The first reflection being a proper introduction from "jot as co-founder" is clever positioning - makes the product feel less like a robot and more like a partner who took time to understand their work.

## Observations

20 commits in 2 hours screams either micro-commits or thrashing. The dark/light mode toggle at 11:11 PM feels like procrastination - your users don't care about theme switching when the core product is still being built. Same with the multiple documentation updates to claude.md.

The good news: you actually fixed real problems. Fetching commits from all branches was broken, the commit cutoff logic was wrong, and the first-time experience was terrible. These weren't yak shaves - they were blocking real user value.

But then you spent Friday morning polishing email templates. Classic scope creep when you should be validating the core loop works.

## Questions for Tomorrow

Are people actually using the reflections you're generating, or are you building features for a user that doesn't exist yet? You have the write-to-repo feature working - time to get this in front of real developers and see if they find value in daily AI reflections about their work.

What's the one thing preventing you from getting your first paying customer? It's probably not email styling.
