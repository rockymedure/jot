## What You Did

Landed a major feature branch (`deeplook`) with 2,665 lines of changes - looks like you built out deep review functionality with email notifications, summary extraction, and issue parsing. Then spent the afternoon fixing what broke: timezone parsing bugs, dashboard query issues, security vulnerabilities (XSS, regex backtracking), and making the review parser more flexible when it couldn't handle different output formats.

Added proper rate limiting to GitHub API calls and DOMPurify sanitization. Updated docs to reflect the new streaming and security features.

## Observations

Classic pattern of big feature merge followed by cleanup commits. You had to touch the review parsing logic three separate times (commits a7c3b73, d439407, 0c3e1fd) which suggests either the AI output wasn't as predictable as expected, or the initial implementation was brittle. 

The security fixes look like they came from an actual code review - good that you're doing that, but some of these (XSS prevention, catastrophic backtracking) should have been caught earlier.

The timezone bug fix involved 587 lines of changes, which seems excessive for what should be a utility function fix. Might be worth questioning if you're over-engineering the solution.

## Questions for Tomorrow

Are you spending too much time making the AI parsing "flexible" instead of just making the prompts more deterministic? Why not control the input format strictly rather than handling every possible output variation?

What's your testing strategy for these features - are you catching these bugs in development or finding them in production?

## Positioning Exploration (Late Night)

Rethinking the landing page messaging. Moving away from "blunt co-founder" framing toward something more constructive:

**Old positioning**: Accountability, calling out distractions, tough love
**New direction**: Clarity, direction, understanding what you built and what's next

### Core insight
The real question founders ask isn't "what am I avoiding?" — it's:
- What did I build today?
- Why did I build it?
- What should I build next?
- (Weekly) What's the shape of this thing?

### Headlines being tested

1. **Original**: "Your AI co-founder, in your inbox."
2. "See what you're building."
3. "What should I build next?"
4. "Clarity, every morning."
5. "Know what you built. Know what's next."
6. "Finally see your own progress."

### Notes
- Don't want to be too specific about mechanism ("reads your commits") — prefer "jot understands what you built"
- Weekly reflections mentioned as important for seeing the bigger picture
- Built a FAB toggle on homepage to cycle through variants for testing
