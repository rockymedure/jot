## What You Did

You tackled a solid mix of critical fixes and user experience improvements today. Started the day squashing some nasty bugs - fixed the Claude API token configuration that was breaking quiet day reflections, and solved a tricky streaming buffer issue where incomplete SSE lines were causing reflections to fail silently. That's the kind of infrastructure work that prevents late-night support tickets.

The admin dashboard got some love too - you added next reflection timing (with nice color coding) and a "What Customers Are Building" section that gives you real visibility into how people are using jot. Smart to invest in your own operational awareness.

But the real star of the day was the comic generation flow. You solved a fundamental data loss problem by saving reflections *before* attempting comic generation, added proper timeouts, and then polished it off with that delightful animated loader - complete with rotating witty messages and sparkles. That's the kind of touch that makes software feel alive.

## Observations

This felt like a "systems thinking" day - you weren't just fixing individual bugs, but improving the whole reliability story. The reflection save-before-comic-generation change shows mature product intuition - always preserve the core value even if the nice-to-have fails.

The comic loader work is particularly strong because it turns a technical constraint (generation takes time) into a moment of delight. Users aren't just waiting, they're being entertained by an animated pencil drawing their comic. That's good product design.

Your commit discipline is solid - clear messages, logical separation of concerns, and good timing on when to ship versus when to iterate.

## Questions for Tomorrow

How are users actually responding to the comic generation feature? With the new loading states and auto-refresh, are they sticking around for the full generation cycle?

Should you consider adding some user feedback mechanism during that 2.5-minute generation window - maybe let them know roughly how much longer, or give them something interactive to do while waiting?
